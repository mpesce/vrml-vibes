Vibe coding a VRML 1.0 browser for macOS with Antigravity

###VRML 1.0?###
Yes, as one of the co-inventors of VRML (with @tparisi), we both want to see some of that original content again.
VRML 1.0 had a brief life - not much more than a year - before being replaced by VRML 2.0/VRML 97. There was very little backward compatibility beyond 1-to-2 conversion tools.
So there's a fair bit of content that can not now be viewed without a VRML 1.0 browser.
And here it is.

So far this has taken a few evenings with Google Antigravity and Gemini Pro 3.
It's written the code. I've been doing the debugging. 😑

The basic prompt fed Antigravity the [VRML 1.0 Specification(https://paulbourke.net/dataformats/vrml1/)] with an instruction to target macOS and Metal.
After that it was steering, testing, and basically being a pipe between Antigravity and Xcode.
